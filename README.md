# üõ†Ô∏è CSE310 Compiler

A full compiler for a subset of the C programming language, built as part of the **CSE310: Compiler Design** course. This project implements the complete compilation pipeline‚Äîfrom tokenizing to code generation‚Äîwith a strong focus on **educational clarity** and **modular design**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Symbol Table** implemented in modern C++
- **Lexical Analysis** using Flex (yyFlex)
- **Parsing** with ANTLR4 (C++ implementation)
- **Intermediate Code Generation (ICG)** using ANTLR visitors
- **Final Code Output** in x86 Assembly
- Supports generation of `.asm` files executable in emulators (e.g., **EMU8086**, **DOSBox**)


## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cse310-compiler.git
   cd cse310-compiler

    Set up ANTLR4 (C++ target):

        Follow this guide to install ANTLR4 in a virtual environment.

    Activate the virtual environment:

source antlr-venv/bin/activate

Put your C-like source code inside ICG/input/ folder, for example:

ICG/input/input.txt

Run the compiler:

./run-script.sh input/input.txt

Check output:
The generated x86 Assembly will be located at:

ICG optimized_code.asm

üß™ Example
‚úÖ Input (C-like Source Code)

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 3;
    int c = a + b;
    println(c);
}

üìö What I Learned

Implementing a multi-stage compiler with real tools (Flex, ANTLR, x86)
- Designing grammar rules and resolving ambiguities
- Managing memory and scopes using custom symbol tables
- Generating working 8086 assembly code for real emulators
- Writing automation scripts to streamline the toolchain

üôè Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the knowledge, support, and guidance of the following individuals and communities:

- Nafis Tahmid, Ahmed Rumi, and Anwarul Bashir Shuaib ‚Äî for their outstanding mentorship, lectures, and continued encouragement throughout the CSE310: Compiler Design course.
- The creators of Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) ‚Äî for providing an efficient tool to build our lexer with minimal hassle.
- The ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) community ‚Äî for making grammar-driven parsing intuitive, powerful, and accessible.
- To all of my peers who offered feedback, testing support, and discussions during development.
- I'm sincerely grateful for your contributions to this learning journey.
